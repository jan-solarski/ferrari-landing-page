				<h1>Ferrari: Italian luxury</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Founded by <strong>Enzo Ferrari</strong> in <em>1939</em> out of the Alfa Romeo race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni,
				the company built its first car in 1940, and produced its first Ferrari-badged car in 1947.</p>

			<p>Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in <strong>Formula One</strong>,
				where it is <em>the oldest and most successful racing team</em>, holding the most constructors championships (16) and
				having produced the highest number of drivers' championship wins (15).</p>

			<h3>Noticable Presidents</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Enzo Ferrari (1939–1977)</li>
				<li>Vittorio Ghidella (1984–1988)</li>
				<li>Luca Cordero di Montezemolo (1991–2014)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Most Ferraris were also given designations referring to their <strong>body style</strong>. In general, the following conventions
				were used:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>M</strong> ("Modificata"), placed at the end of a model's number, denotes a modified version of its predecessor
					and not a complete evolution (see F512 M and 575 M Maranello).</li>
				<li><strong>GTB</strong> ("Gran Turismo Berlinetta") models are closed Berlinettas, or coupés.</li>
				<li><strong>GTS</strong> ("Gran Turismo Scoperta") this suffix can be seen in older spiders, or convertibles (see 365 GTS/4).</li>
				<li><strong>GTO</strong> ("Gran Turismo Omologata"), placed at the end of a model's number, denotes a modified version of
					its predecessor. It designates a model that has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being street
					legal. </li>

						stallion on a yellow shield, usually with the letters S F <em>(for Scuderia Ferrari)</em>, with three stripes of green,
						white and red (the Italian national colors) at the top. The road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood (see picture
